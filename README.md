### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Ankit
I am a polyglot engineer who likes to create frontend and backend solutions for the modern web. I am curious to solve engineering problems that require scale and handling heavy traffic load. I have primarily been a Gopher for the past year and it continues to excite me everyday. When I do change to tasks which are frontend focussed I create components in React and handle state management using Redux. As a side project I have worked with React frameworks like NextJS and GatsbyJS, infact NextJS is also currently powering my personal site.
